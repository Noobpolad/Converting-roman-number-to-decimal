Write a program to convert Roman numbers to Decimal numbers.

Roman numbers use combinations of the letters: 

I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), M (1000)

A smaller value following a larger one is added to it, while preceding a larger one is subtracted from it.

So for example:

3 = III

7 = VII

15 = XV

23 = XXIII
